# Data  

This folder contains the dataset files used in the project. The dataset comprises four files: beer.csv, brewer.csv, person.csv, and review.csv. These files contain relevant information about beers, brewers, persons, and reviews, respectively.

### Dataset Files
- `beer_reviews.csv`: This file contains the original dataset retrieved from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rdoume/beerreviews)
- `beer.csv`: This file contains details about different beers, including their ID, name, ABV (Alcohol By Volume), and style.
- `brewer.csv`: This file provides information about brewers, such as their ID and brewery name.
- `person.csv`: This file includes data related to persons, including their ID and profile name.
- `review.csv`: This file contains reviews for various beers, including the appearance, aroma, palate, taste, time, beer ID, reviewer ID, and the total rating.  

### File Format
Each dataset file is stored in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format, making it easy to read and process using various data analysis tools and programming languages.

### Data Usage
These dataset files will be used throughout the project for:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the characteristics and patterns within the data.
2. Data Mining and Machine Learning: Building models to predict beer ratings, identify trends, or recommend beers based on user preferences.

### Dataset Attribution
The dataset files in this folder have been collected and prepared for the project. The original source of the data was [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rdoume/beerreviews) and we normalized the initial one file dataset into the four tables in this folder.
