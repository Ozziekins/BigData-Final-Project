# Dashboard
This folder contains the code and files related to the project's dashboard. The dashboard is built using Streamlit, a powerful Python library for creating interactive web applications.

### Files
- `dashboard.py`: This file is the Streamlit application written in Python 2.7. It provides an interface to display the results of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Predictive Data Analysis (PDA). You can run this file by executing the command streamlit run dashboard/dashboard.py in your terminal.

- `streamlit_app.py`: This file is the Streamlit application written in Python 3.5. It serves the same purpose as dashboard.py but is compatible with Python 3.5. To run this file, use the command streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py.

### Usage
The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to explore and analyze the project's data. It offers a range of features, including:

1. Displaying data characteristics: Get an overview of the dataset, including the number of records, columns, and data types.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and explore different aspects of the data using interactive charts, plots, and tables.
3. Predictive Data Analysis (PDA): Apply machine learning models and algorithms to make predictions or generate insights from the data.
4. Customization: The dashboard can be customized and extended based on specific project requirements. You can modify the code to include additional visualizations, metrics, or interactive elements.

### Running the Dashboard
To run the dashboard on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Ozziekins/BigData-Final-Project`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd BigData-Final-Project`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Streamlit application using one of the following commands:
    - For Python 2.7: `streamlit run dashboard/dashboard.py`
    - For Python 3.5: `streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py`
The Streamlit application will start a local web server, and you can access the dashboard in your web browser by visiting the provided URL.

### Note
Please note that the dashboard is designed for the project's specific dataset and analysis objectives. If you intend to use it with your own data or modify it for a different project, you may need to adapt the code and configurations accordingly.

Feel free to explore the different features of the dashboard and leverage its capabilities to gain insights and visualize the project's data.
