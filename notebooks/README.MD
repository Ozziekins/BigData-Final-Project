# Notebooks
This folder contains the Zeppelin notebook for the Stage III - Predictive Data Analytics of our project. The notebook is designed to guide you through the process of building a machine learning (ML) model for the dataset we have and performing hyperparameter tuning using GridSearch.

### File
- `zeppelin_notebook.json`: This file contains the Zeppelin notebook for the Predictive Data Analytics stage. Zeppelin is an open-source web-based notebook that enables data exploration, visualization, and collaboration. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide and code snippets to help you build and evaluate an ML model using the dataset.

### Usage
To use the Zeppelin notebook and leverage its functionalities for the Predictive Data Analytics stage, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Zeppelin installed and properly configured in your environment. Zeppelin supports various programming languages, including Python, SQL, and Scala, and provides a flexible and interactive environment for data analysis and ML development.

2. Open Zeppelin and create a new notebook.

3. Import the zeppelin_notebook.json file into the new notebook. This will load the notebook with the predefined sections, code snippets, and instructions for the Predictive Data Analytics stage.

4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code cells, explore the dataset, and build the ML model. The notebook will guide you through the necessary steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

5. Make sure to run each code cell sequentially to ensure proper execution and avoid any dependencies issues. The notebook is designed to provide a structured and organized approach to the Predictive Data Analytics stage, allowing you to understand and reproduce the analysis easily.

6. Modify the notebook as needed, such as adapting it to different ML algorithms, adjusting hyperparameters, or incorporating additional evaluation metrics. Zeppelin provides a rich set of features and integrations that allow you to customize the notebook to meet your specific requirements.


Please note that the zeppelin_notebook.json file is specific to the Predictive Data Analytics stage of our project and assumes the availability of the dataset and the target variables. If you are working with a different dataset or have specific requirements, you may need to modify the notebook accordingly.
